# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis.

# Problem Statement
There are many aspects considered when choosing a hotel. The main idea is to find the appropriate prediction model for predicting hotel booking cancellations which finds the finest explaining variables for customer cancellations. This Hotel Booking Cancellation model can be useful not only for the vacationer but for the hotels’ owners.

# The steps for the implementation
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Data Pre-Processing
3. Model Building

# Evaluation Matrix
select the right evaluation matrix that is robust to the imbalanced dataset such as confusion matrix, f1 score, precision, Recall.
A simple and yet good metric that always helps when dealing with classification problems is the confusion matrix. A confusion matrix is a table that is used to represent
the performance of a classification model (or “classifier”) on a set of test data for which the true values are known. Thus, it is a terrific starting point for any classification model evaluation.

# Conclusion
The given dataset is a supervised classification dataset. It holds booking information for Villa and Motel with information such as How and when the booking was made, the number of adults, children, and babies. The Logistic regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest algorithms, K Nearest Neighbor Classification Algorithm are used to handle this supervised classification model. Among these four machine learning algorithms, Random forest and Decision trees perform well with respect to accuracy.
